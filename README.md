#  Hey all, Diego here.  [<img src="https://github.com/diegocoxta/diegocoxta/blob/main/dc.png" width="50" align="right" />](https://diegocosta.me)

I'm a Engineering Manager passionate about the intersection between technology and people. My goal is to help technology teams achieve their full potential.

I have a great interest in engineering leadership, people management, software engineering, as well as inclusion and diversity. I have extensive experience in JavaScript-based technologies such as React, React Native, Gatsby, GraphQL, and Node, but I'm always looking to learn new things. 

Currently, I'm studying distributed systems concepts, Mandarim, improving my English, and learning to play bass.
