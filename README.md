#  Hey all, Diego here.  [<img src="https://github.com/diegocoxta/diegocoxta/blob/main/icon.png" width="50" align="right" />](https://diegocosta.me)

I'm a Engineering Manager passionate about the intersection between technology and people. My goal is to help technology teams achieve their full potential.

My areas of expertise include engineering leadership, people management, software engineering, and inclusion and diversity. Currently, I'm in the position of Engineering Manager at Nubank and I'm always willing to share my ideas and experiences on these topics.

I have extensive experience in JavaScript-based technologies such as React, React Native, Gatsby, GraphQL, and Node, but I'm always looking to learn new things. Currently, I'm studying Clojure and its ecosystem, distributed systems concepts, improving my English, and learning to play bass.
