# Hey all, Diego here.

I'm a Engineering Manager passionate about the intersection between technology and people. My goal is to help technology teams achieve their full potential.

I have a great interest in engineering leadership, people management, software engineering, as well as inclusion and diversity. Currently, I am an Engineering Manager at Nubank and I am always open to sharing my ideas and experiences on these topics.

I have extensive experience in JavaScript-based technologies such as React, React Native, Gatsby, GraphQL, and Node, but I'm always looking to learn new things. Currently, I'm studying Clojure and its ecosystem, distributed systems concepts, improving my English, and learning to play bass.

### Tech Manager @ [Nubank](https://international.nubank.com.br/)
#### feb 2021 - jan 2023

As the technical manager of the team, I led the redesign of the app homepage to allow for the expansion and addition of new products without compromising the user experience, which contributed to delivering excellent service to our base of 70 million customers. You can find this work in the attached media.

My main responsibilities included people management, with a focus on individual development, conflict management, guidance on performance and expectations, as well as conducting bi-annual performance evaluations to ensure employee growth or create performance recovery plans when necessary. Additionally, I was responsible for building and dividing teams, promoting a culture of feedback and psychological safety, conducting individual and group meetings, and continuously improving team processes. I also made important choices in software architecture to ensure delivery quality and actively participated in the recruitment process and diversity campaigns.

### Mobile Developer Consultant @ [Suno](https://suno.com.br)
#### jul 2020 - dec 2020

I was invited by Suno Research to develop the company's first mobile application. I worked closely with the product team to gather requirements, detail the roadmap and backlog. In addition, I was responsible for defining the technologies to be used, guiding two junior engineers through code reviews and mentoring, setting up accounts on the Apple Store and Google Play, and building the entire CI/CD process. Although it was a challenging project due to the tight deadline, we launched a complete application in less than 6 months with audio streaming, daily updated recommended investment portfolios, and PDF report reading capabilities.

I opted to use a technology stack with React Native, Styled Components, Typescript, and Apollo Client for GraphQL requests. These technologies were chosen for their ability to simplify integration for other engineers interested in mobile application development, as well as to reduce hiring costs.

### Tech Manager @ [Sanar](https://www.sanarmed.com/)
#### jul 2018 - dec 2020

As a Tech Manager or Tech Lead, I led multifunctional teams and supported other teams in the frontend area. I developed the frontend architecture for all products and applications, creating a white-label and monorepo platform that can be easily replicated to build new products with small configuration adjustments. Additionally, I led diversity and inclusion initiatives in the technology hiring process and promoted internal and external training programs.

During my last year at Sanar, I led the complete overhaul of the SanarFlix streaming service application, actively participating in the development of a user-friendly interface and utilizing updated technologies. The result was an application that became an internal reference and a basis for other projects in the company.

Key achievements:  

- Acted as Tech Manager responsible for the development of the SanarFlix application and corresponding web platform, using technologies such as React Native, Styled Components, and Apollo Client.
- Developed features such as video streaming, quizzes, and in-app purchases, as well as support for Chromecast streaming and single sign-on using AWS Cognito.
- Defined the monorepo and CI/CD strategy for the project, as well as the component architecture for the platform, implementing a white-label system.
- Contributed to the development of Sanar Residência Médica's first application, with features such as Spaced Repetition and user classification.

### Senior Software Engineer @ [Sanar](https://www.sanarmed.com/)
#### mar 2018 - jul 2020

I started at Sanar as a Software Engineer, tasked with building new products and introducing the company to the world of mobile apps using React Native. With a challenging deadline and a lean team, I successfully delivered a free app to help medical students prepare for their residency exam. This project was very challenging, as we had to create an updated question bank and ensure a good user experience and gamification of the platform using the spaced repetition technique. In no time, the app became one of the top ten educational apps in the major stores and started a new business area that became the company's flagship.

Furthermore, I became a reference in frontend and guided several teams and products on appropriate technologies and methodologies. I led the overhaul of all streaming portals using React and GraphQL and was responsible for hiring and retaining entire frontend teams.

In addition to React, React Native, and GraphQL, I had the opportunity to work with Laravel, NodeJS, MongoDB, and Typescript. I also occasionally used jQuery and PHP in legacy projects.
